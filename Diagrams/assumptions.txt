Assumptions made regarding Relational Diagram:

- All Nutritional supplies are kept in a kitchen in each facility
- Services are scheduled every time they need to be done (not on a weekly, daily, monthly basis)
- All staff members are legal age to be working in a hospital (we don't keep their age in any of the tables)
- Every staff member's ID will exist in one of the following tables: Director, Administrators, Nurses, Technicians, Doctor, Interns, or Residents.
- There will never be a 4th facility (this would require additional choices for the ENUM)
- All patients have a medicare card
- No more than 3 directors will be added into the Director table
